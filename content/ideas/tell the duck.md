A theraphy website. Idea by [Rubber duck debugging - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) but instead of fixing your bugs, it'll hopefully help with your sadness, stress, anxiety or whatever.


## What to do
- Input where the user tells how they feel and what they're doing.
- Maybe use that to share with others to let them help
- Or create automation of somesort that the duck will talk to you to help
