# Have you ever wished to go back in time to fix something
I'm sure most people probably had at some point in their life.
We want to turn something that we regret better.

# The question is
How do we know that if we do something it would turn out better.
It may turn some situation better, but remember. 

Our lives are the result of our past decision. Your current happiness, sadness, disappointment, excitement are results of your past decision.

What if that decision makes that situation better, but makes other situation worse?

# An example
![Decision 1](images/decision1.png)

You regret that you should've bought pizza to eat and invite your friends over.

Now you ~~know~~  imagine that you would've been happier if you didn't choose to cook at home.

![Decision 2](images/decision2.png)

Here's the catch, you die with a heart attack sooner therefore spending less time with your friends if you chose to order pizza.

Now this example is too simplistic and there would be **much much** more variables and decisions that could cause a heart attack / changing you in the *future*.

# The point is

![Decision 3](images/decision3.png)

We have **absolutely** no way of knowing the future ( for now ), so why bother spending your *present* time regretting your decisions?

Everytime that you've been happy is caused by that decision **that you regret**, what if you wouldn't currently be happy if you chose the other choice?

# What to take from this

- **stop wanting to change the past, it's a waste of time**
- use the past decisions as a lesson to make your future decisions better
- think when you decide something lol
